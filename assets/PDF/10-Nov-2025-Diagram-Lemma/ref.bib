  abstract = {We give a simultaneous generalization of exact categories and triangulated categories, which is suitable for considering cotorsion pairs, and which we call extriangulated categories. Extension-closed, full subcategories of triangulated categories are examples of extriangulated categories. We give a bijective correspondence between some pairs of cotorsion pairs which we call Hovey twin cotorsion pairs, and admissible model structures. As a consequence, these model structures relate certain localizations with certain ideal quotients, via the homotopy category which can be given a triangulated structure. This gives a natural framework to formulate reduction and mutation of cotorsion pairs, applicable to both exact categories and triangulated categories. These results can be thought of as arguments towards the view that extriangulated categories are a convenient setup for writing down proofs which apply to both exact categories and (extension-closed subcategories of) triangulated categories.},

  abstract = {Extriangulated categories were introduced by Nakaoka and Palu by extracting the similarities between exact categories and triangulated categories. A notion of homotopy cartesian square in an extriangulated category is defined in this article. We prove that in an extriangulated category with enough projective objects, the extension subcategory of two covariantly finite subcategories is covariantly finite. As an application, we give a simultaneous generalization of a result of X. W. Chen (2009) and of a result of R. Gentle, G. Todorov (1996).}

We prove that the heart is abelian, and construct a cohomological functor to the heart. If the extriangulated category has enough projectives, this functor gives an equivalence between the heart and the category of coherent functors over the coheart modulo projectives. We also show how an n-cluster tilting subcategory of an extriangulated category gives rise to a family of cotorsion pairs with equivalent hearts.},

All diagram lemmas are proved directly from the axioms, notably the five lemma, the 3\texttimes 3-lemma and the snake lemma. We briefly discuss exact functors, idempotent completion and weak idempotent completeness. We then show that it is possible to construct the derived category of an exact category without any embedding into abelian categories and we sketch Deligne's approach to derived functors. The construction of classical derived functors with values in an abelian category painlessly translates to exact categories, i.e., we give proofs of the comparison theorem for projective resolutions and the horseshoe lemma. After discussing some examples we elaborate on Thomason's proof of the Gabriel--Quillen embedding theorem in an appendix.},
