The Homotopy Category of Hovey Model Structure

Let (𝒜,𝔼,𝔰) be a weakly idempotent complete extriangulated category equipped with Hovey triple (𝒞,𝒲,ℱ). By the Hovey correspondence one obtains a model structure (aka. Hovey model structure). We revisit the proof that the homotpy category 𝖧𝗈 𝒜 is triangulated. Let ℬ := (𝒞 ∩ ℱ) denote the class of bifibrant objects. Then the full subcategory (𝖧𝗈 𝒜) ∩ ℬ is equivalent to 𝖧𝗈 𝒜, and moreover isomorphic to the localisation ℬ[(𝖶𝖾𝗊 in ℬ) ⁻¹], the homotopy category ℬ/∼, and the additive quotient 𝖲𝗍(ℬ) carrying a triangulated structure. The ideal quotient ℬ/(ℬ ∩ 𝒲) inherits an extriangulated substructure of 𝑆𝑡(ℬ). We also analysis some conditions when ℬ/(ℬ ∩ 𝒲) coincides with 𝖲𝗍(ℬ).
