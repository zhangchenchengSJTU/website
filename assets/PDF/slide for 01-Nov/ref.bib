  abstract = {We give a simultaneous generalization of exact categories and triangulated categories, which is suitable for considering cotorsion pairs, and which we call extriangulated categories. Extension-closed, full subcategories of triangulated categories are examples of extriangulated categories. We give a bijective correspondence between some pairs of cotorsion pairs which we call Hovey twin cotorsion pairs, and admissible model structures. As a consequence, these model structures relate certain localizations with certain ideal quotients, via the homotopy category which can be given a triangulated structure. This gives a natural framework to formulate reduction and mutation of cotorsion pairs, applicable to both exact categories and triangulated categories. These results can be thought of as arguments towards the view that extriangulated categories are a convenient setup for writing down proofs which apply to both exact categories and (extension-closed subcategories of) triangulated categories.},

All diagram lemmas are proved directly from the axioms, notably the five lemma, the 3{\texttimes}3-lemma and the snake lemma. We briefly discuss exact functors, idempotent completion and weak idempotent completeness. We then show that it is possible to construct the derived category of an exact category without any embedding into abelian categories and we sketch Deligne's approach to derived functors. The construction of classical derived functors with values in an abelian category painlessly translates to exact categories, i.e., we give proofs of the comparison theorem for projective resolutions and the horseshoe lemma. After discussing some examples we elaborate on Thomason's proof of the Gabriel--Quillen embedding theorem in an appendix.},

In this article, we develop Auslander--Reiten theory for extriangulated categories. This unifies Auslander--Reiten theories developed in exact categories and triangulated categories independently. We give two different sets of sufficient conditions on the extriangulated category so that existence of almost split extensions becomes equivalent to that of an Auslander--Reiten--Serre duality. We also show that existence of almost split extensions is preserved under taking relative extriangulated categories, ideal quotients, and extension-closed subcategories. Moreover, we prove that the stable category \${\textbackslash}underline\{{\textbackslash}mathscr\{C\}\}\$ of an extriangulated category \${\textbackslash}mathscr\{C\}\$ is a \${$\tau\$$}-category if \${\textbackslash}mathscr\{C\}\$ has enough projectives, almost split extensions and source morphisms. This gives various consequences on \${\textbackslash}underline\{{\textbackslash}mathscr\{C\}\}\$, including Igusa--Todorov's Radical Layers Theorem, Auslander--Reiten Combinatorics on dimensions of Hom-spaces, and Reconstruction Theorem of the associated completely graded category of \${\textbackslash}underline\{{\textbackslash}mathscr\{C\}\}\$ via the complete mesh category of the Auslander--Reiten species of \${\textbackslash}underline\{{\textbackslash}mathscr\{C\}\}\$. Finally we prove that any locally finite symmetrizable \${$\tau\$$}-quiver (=valued translation quiver) is an Auslander--Reiten quiver of some extriangulated category with sink morphisms and source morphisms.},

In recent years representation theory has been an area of intense research and the author shows that derived categories of finite-dimensional algebras are a useful tool in studying tilting processes. Results on the structure of derived categories of hereditary algebras are used to investigate Dynkin algebras and interated tilted algebras. The author shows how triangulated categories arise naturally in the study of Frobenius categories. The study of trivial extension algebras and repetitive algebras is then developed using the triangulated structure on the stable category of the algebra's module category. With a comprehensive reference section, algebraists and research students in this field will find this an indispensable account of the theory of finite-dimensional algebras.},

Important types of exact categories, including n-tilting torsion classes, categories of Cohen-Macaulay modules over a Cohen-Macaulay order, or categories of Gorenstein projectives, are shown to be of the form T(A). The quotient category T(A)/A in the sense of Grothendieck always exists and carries a triangulated structure. More generally, it is proved that any biresolving subcategory A of an exact category M gives a triangulated localization M/A. For example, the unbounded derived category D(A) of an exact category A is obtained directly, with no passage through a homotopy category of complexes. As applications, some recent developments related to Gorenstein projectivity, non-commutative crepant resolutions, singularity categories, and Cohen-Macaulay representations are extended and improved in the new framework. For example, the concept of non-commutative resolution of a noetherian Frobenius category is extended to arbitrary exact categories, which leads to an overarching connection with representation dimension of exact categories and n-tilting.}

  abstract = {We initiate the study of derived functors in the setting of extriangulated categories. By using coends, we adapt Yoneda's theory of higher extensions to this framework. We show that, when there are enough projectives or enough injectives, thus defined extensions agree with the ones defined earlier via projective or injective resolutions. For categories with enough projective or enough injective morphisms, we prove that these are right derived functors of the \${\textbackslash}operatorname\{Hom\}\$-bifunctor in either argument. Since \${\textbackslash}operatorname\{Hom\}\$ is only half-exact in each argument, it is natural to expect "negative extensions", i.e. its left derived functors, to exist and not necessarily vanish. We define negative extensions with respect to the first and to the second argument and show that they give rise to universal \${\textbackslash}delta\$-functors, when there are enough projective or injective morphisms, respectively. In general, they are not balanced. However, for topological extriangulated categories, the existence of a balanced version of negative extensions follows from combining the work of Klemenc on exact \${\textbackslash}infty\$-categories with results of the second and third authors. We discuss various criteria under which one has the balance of the above bifunctors on the functorial or on the numerical levels. This happens, in particular, in the cases of exact or triangulated categories, and also in the case of the category of \$n\$-term complexes with projective components over a finite-dimensional algebra. Given a connected sequence of functors on an extriangulated category \$({\textbackslash}mathcal\{C\},{\textbackslash}mathbb\{E\},{\textbackslash}mathfrak\{s\})\$, we determine the maximal relative extriangulated structure, with respect to which the sequence is a \${\textbackslash}delta\$-functor. We also find several equivalent criteria for the existence of enough projective or injective morphisms in a given extriangulated category.},

  abstract = {Model categories are used as a tool for inverting certain maps in a category in a controllable manner. As such, they are useful in diverse areas of mathematics. The list of such areas is continually growing.  This book is a comprehensive study of the relationship between a model category and its homotopy category. The author develops the theory of model categories, giving a careful development of the main examples. One highlight of the theory is a proof that the homotopy category of any model category is naturally a closed module over the homotopy category of simplicial sets.  Little is required of the reader beyond some category theory and set theory, which makes the book accessible to advanced graduate students. The book begins with the basic theory of model categories and proceeds to a careful exposition of the main examples, using the theory of cofibrantly generated model categories. It then develops the general theory more fully, showing in particular that the homotopy category of any model category is a module over the homotopy category of simplicial sets, in an appropriate sense. This leads to a simplification and generalisation of the loop and suspension functors in the homotopy category of a pointed model category. The book concludes with a discussion of the stable case, where the homotopy category is triangulated in a strong sense and has a set of small weak generators.},

In proving one of the first major results in the area [1], Alperin and Evens demonstrated the connection of the study of complexity for modules to the group cohomology. That connection eventually led to the categorization of modules according to their associated varieties in the maximal ideal spectrum of the cohomology ring H*(G, k). In all of the work that has followed, two principles have proved to be extremely important. The first is that the associated variety of a module is directly related to the structure of the module through the rank variety which is defined by the matrix representation of the module. The second major result is the tensor product theorem which says that the variety associated to a tensor product M {$\otimes$}kN is the intersection of the varieties associated to the modules M and N. In this paper we generalize these results to infinitely generated kG-modules.},

Two classes \${\textbackslash}mathcal\{A\}\$ and \${\textbackslash}mathcal\{B\}\$ of objects of \${\textbackslash}mathcal\{C\}\$ form a left \$n\$-cotorsion pair \$({\textbackslash}mathcal\{A,B\})\$ in \${\textbackslash}mathcal\{C\}\$ if the orthogonality relation \${\textbackslash}mathsf\{Ext\}{\textasciicircum}i\_\{{\textbackslash}mathcal\{C\}\}({\textbackslash}mathcal\{A,B\}) = 0\$ is satisfied for indexes \$1 {\textbackslash}leq i {\textbackslash}leq n\$, and if every object of \${\textbackslash}mathcal\{C\}\$ has a resolution by objects in \${\textbackslash}mathcal\{A\}\$ whose syzygies have \${\textbackslash}mathcal\{B\}\$-resolution dimension at most \$n-1\$. This concept and its dual generalise the notion of complete cotorsion pairs, and has an appealing relation with left and right approximations, especially with those having the so called unique mapping property. The main purpose of this paper is to describe several properties of \$n\$-cotorsion pairs and to establish a relation with complete cotorsion pairs. We also give some applications in relative homological algebra, that will cover the study of approximations associated to Gorenstein projective, Gorenstein injective and Gorenstein flat modules and chain complexes, as well as \$m\$-cluster tilting subcategories.},

  abstract = {We begin by showing that in a triangulated category, specifying a projective class is equivalent to specifying an ideal I of morphisms with certain properties, and that if I has these properties, then so does each of its powers. We show how a projective class leads to an Adams spectral sequence and give some results on the convergence and collapsing of this spectral sequence. We use this to study various ideals. In the stable homotopy category we examine phantom maps, skeletal phantom maps, superphantom maps, and ghosts. (A ghost is a map which induces the zero map of homotopy groups.) We show that ghosts lead to a stable analogue of the Lusternik-Schnirelmann category of a space, and we calculate this stable analogue for low-dimensional real projective spaces. We also give a relation between ghosts and the Hopf and Kervaire invariant problems. In the case of A-infinity modules over an A-infinity ring spectrum, the ghost spectral sequence is a universal coefficient spectral sequence. From the phantom projective class we derive a generalized Milnor sequence for filtered diagrams of finite spectra, and from this it follows that the group of phantom maps from X to Y can always be described as a lim{\textasciicircum}1 group. The last two sections focus on algebraic examples. In the derived category of an abelian category we study the ideal of maps inducing the zero map of homology groups and find a natural setting for a result of Kelly on the vanishing of composites of such maps. We also explain how pure exact sequences relate to phantom maps in the derived category of a ring and give an example showing that phantoms can compose non-trivially.},

Our main result provides a natural description of the mapping spaces between two dg-categories \$C\$ and \$D\$ in terms of the nerve of a certain category of \$(C,D)\$-bimodules. We also prove that the homotopy category \$Ho(dg-Cat)\$ is cartesian closed (i.e. possesses internal Hom's relative to the tensor product). We use these two results in order to prove a derived version of Morita theory, describing the morphisms between dg-categories of modules over two dg-categories \$C\$ and \$D\$ as the dg-category of \$(C,D)\$-bi-modules. Finally, we give three applications of our results. The first one expresses Hochschild cohomology as endomorphisms of the identity functor, as well as higher homotopy groups of the {\textbackslash}emph\{classifying space of dg-categories\} (i.e. the nerve of the category of dg-categories and quasi-equivalences between them). The second application is the existence of a good theory of localization for dg-categories, defined in terms of a natural universal property. Our last application states that the dg-category of (continuous) morphisms between the dg-categories of quasi-coherent (resp. perfect) complexes on two schemes (resp. smooth and proper schemes) is quasi-equivalent to the dg-category of quasi-coherent complexes (resp. perfect) on their product.},

As a special case we show that under very general conditions the categories \$Ch\_\{+\}(E)\$, \$Ch\_\{{\textbackslash}ge0\}(E)\$, and \$Ch(E)\$ are equipped with the projective model structure, and that a generalisation of the Dold-Kan correspondence holds. We also establish conditions under which categories of filtered objects in exact categories are equipped with natural model structures. When \$E\$ is monoidal we also examine when these model structures are monoidal and conclude by studying some homotopical algebra in such categories. In particular we provide conditions under which \$Ch(E)\$ and \$Ch\_\{{\textbackslash}ge0\}(E)\$ are homotopical algebra contexts, thus making them suitable settings for derived geometry.},
